          <p className="left-align light">Bud’s and Suds brings people closer……to beer!

            Our app allows users to find, create and modify bar crawls around the city. With the ability to join an existing crawl, create a custom crawl, invite as many “Bud’s” as you want and to edit and monitor the progress of the crawl, this is the only crawl app you’ll ever need.
            The integrated map feature allows users to check-in to each bar upon arrival and keep tabs on each individual “Bud” in real time throughout the crawl to ensure no “Bud” is left behind.
            Bud’s and Suds also allows users to create custom profiles with drink preferences, interests, favorite sports / teams, music and location. There’s even a place to indicate if you’re available for dating to let other users know that you’re single and ready to mingle!
            All these amazing features make Bud’s and Suds your one-stop shop for a responsibly planned night of crawling for beers with your buds</p>
